This README.md file regard only the Python implementation. For a general description of the project please refer to the parent directory.

The Project_v3.ipynb file is the Jupyter Notebook of the Python implementation. It calls the files contained in the folder "Packages" to import all the needed functions. 

As explained in the README.md in the parent directory, the Python implementation, although complete, has not been cleaned and prepared for a presentation. Therefore it lacks of description. However, almost all the passages should be clear and the functions have been called using names which should help understanding their utilities.
