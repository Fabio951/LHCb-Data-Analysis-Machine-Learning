This README.txt file regards only the implementation using R.

The main file is the project.ipynb . All the packages are stored in the folder "Packages" and are imported in the main program through the Requirements_and_Functions.R file.
The Jupyter Notebook doesn't contain many results, details and explanation. However, it's possible to find all the descriptions and results in the PDF presentation stored in the main folder.
